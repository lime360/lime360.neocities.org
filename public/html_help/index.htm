You may have noticed that the text sections of GeoCities Basic and Advanced 
HTML editors will accept HTML tags. If you don't know what HTML means, this is a place for 
you to learn. Use this page to learn about HTML and create great home pages. This page is 
meant to be a quick-start reference - not a textbook. It may not answer all of your questions.  
</p><p>
You may find it easiest to open a second browser window and actually work on your page while referencing 
this page at the same time.  You can do that in almost any browser by choosing "New Window" or 
"New Browser Window" from the "File" pulldown menu.  I've created a shortcut that will open one for 
you and take you right to the login page for the File Manager. &nbsp;

<h3>Getting started in GeoCities</h3>
When you registered for your address in GeoCities, your first "Home Page" was 
automatically created for you.  It's a very simple page but can help you get 
started learning basic HTML commands.  If you have already logged into the 
</a><a href="https://neocities.org/dashboard">File Manager</a>, check the box next 
to "index.html", choose "Basic HTML Editor" from the pulldown list, and then 
press "Edit".  You will now be located in the Basic Editor utility and can 
make changes to your page as you read along.  
<p>
<b> Note:</b> Some of the items listed below can't be easily changed using the 
"Basic HTML Editor", but the "Advanced HTML Editor" gives you complete control 
over all page elements.  Once you become familiar with HTML, you'll want to begin 
using the "Advanced HTML Editor".
</p><p>
</p><center><a href="#index">Go to index. </a> </center>
<hr>
<a name="HTML">
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It consists of a set of codes which 
are inserted in a document to control the way the document is displayed by a 
"web browser" such as Netscape Navigator/Communicator or Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. Since you are viewing this document, you must be using a web browser. If it 
has a "view source" feature, you can see what this web page looks like with 
the codes showing. In Netscape, select VIEW, then SOURCE... If you are familiar with 
the hidden codes used by word processors such as WordPerfect, you will see that HTML 
codes are very similar. A document containing these codes is called an HTML document. 
</p><p>An HTML document must have the proper form, so that it will be recognized and 
interpreted properly by the browser software. The basic form is: 
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">
&lt;HTML&gt;
<br>&lt;HEAD&gt;
<br>&lt;TITLE&gt;
<br>&lt;/TITLE&gt;
<br>&lt;/HEAD&gt;
<br>&lt;BODY&gt;
<br>main_part_of_document_goes_here
<br>&lt;/BODY&gt;
<br>&lt;/HTML&gt;
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
You should notice two things here. Opening codes are enclosed in brackets (&lt; &gt;), 
and closing codes include a slash (&lt;/ &gt;).
</p><p>
For example, an HTML document is opened by &lt;HTML&gt; and closed by &lt;/HTML&gt;.
</p><p>
This is true of most (but not all) codes. The GeoCities Basic HTML Editor (located 
within the File Manager Utility) will create the basic document structure for you. 
</p><p>
The best way to learn how to use HTML is to use it. Try out the tips on this home page. 
Each one will teach you a little more. 
</p><p>
</p></a><center><a name="HTML"></a><a href="#index">Go to index. </a> </center>
<hr>
<a name="colors">
<h3>Colors</h3>
Colors, background images, and some other features are controlled by the &lt;BODY&gt; 
tag. GeoCities Basic Editor allows you to choose from several different background colors 
for your home page, by selecting from the many choices listed in the pulldown menus.  
<p>
You can control the color of the background, text, and links in your home page by using 
the &lt;BODY&gt; tag. To control the various colors on your page, the &lt;BODY&gt; tag 
is written like this : 
</p><p>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#xxxxxx" text="#xxxxxx" link="#xxxxxx" vlink="#xxxxxx" alink="#xxxxxx"&gt;
</p><p>
You may include any of the items (bgcolor, text, link, vlink or alink), or leave any 
of them out. To set the color of the background, text, link, visited link, or active link, 
substitute a color value for the xxxxxx in the sample above. Do not make them all the same 
color, or you won't be able to see anything on your page.
</p><p>
Here are a few colors that you can use:
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">
<ul>
<li>White = FFFFFF </li>
<li>Yellow = FFFF66 </li>
<li>Red = FF0000 </li>
<li>Grey = CC9999 </li>
<li>Blue = 0000FF </li>
<li>Green = 00FF00 </li>
<li>Black = 000000 </li>
<li>Purple = CC33FF </li>
<li>Lt. Blue = 00CCFF </li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
These values represent the hexidecimal value of the red/green/blue combination that 
makes up the color. A full explanation of these values is beyond the scope of this page, 
but can be found elsewhere on the web. When you see a color you like on another home page, 
you can use the "view source" feature of your browser to see the code for that 
color. 
</p><p>
If you're comfortable enough already with how to set your own colors, the Basic Editor 
allows you to create your own "Body" tag line by unchecking the box located 
above the pulldown menus, and including the tag directly inside the "Body Text" section.
</p><p>
SUGGESTION: Start out by adding the tag 
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#0066CC" vlink="#336600"&gt;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
as the first item in the "Body Text" window. This will give you the color combination used 
on this page (as long as you have unchecked the box above the pulldown menus). Once you 
have that working, you can experiment with different colors by changing this tag. 
</p><p>
</p></a><center><a name="colors"></a><a href="#index">Go to index.</a></center>
<hr>
<a name="background">
<h3>Background Images</h3>
To add <b>background images</b> instead of background colors, you need to use the attribute 
<b>BACKGROUND</b> in the BODY tag instead of BGCOLOR.  For example, if you wanted to use an 
image named "bg.gif" for your background, the tag would look something like this:
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="bg.gif" text="#000000" link="#0066CC vlink="#336600"&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
</a><p><a name="background">
Note: the image must be located in your own directory in the example above.  If it's located somewhere 
else, you'll need to give the entire path in order for it work successfully.  For more help with 
loading images, please see the section on </a><a href="#graphics">adding graphics to your site</a>.
</p><p>
</p><center><a href="#index">Go to index.</a></center>
<hr>
<a name="lines">
<h3>Horizontal lines</h3>
<p>
You can insert a horizontal line (horizontal rule) in your document by inserting a 
&lt;hr&gt; tag. The default line is a full width, thin, and shaded, like this: 
</p><hr>
<p>
Enhancements to this tag, which are recognized by most browsers, allow more control of 
the appearance of the line. By adding SIZE=NUMBER, the thickness of the line can be 
controlled. The alignment can be controlled by adding ALIGN=LEFT/RIGHT/CENTER. The 
width of the line can be adjusted by adding WIDTH=PERCENT. A black line can be created 
by adding NOSHADE.
</p><p>
Combining these enhancements, 
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;hr size=10 align=left noshade width=50%&gt;</td>

<h3>Bullet lists</h3>

<h3>Paragraph and line breaks</h3>
<p>Web browsers do not respect the way you have formatted your text. They ignore

Inserting a &lt;br&gt; tag will cause the current line to end and a new one to start.

<h3>Creating a jump within your document</h3>
It is easy to create "hot links" within your document that can be 
"clicked" by the reader to jump to another part of the document. There 
are two steps involved. 
<ol>
<li><b>INSERT A TARGET</b> at the point to which you want the link to jump. A target 
looks like this: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>&lt;a name="target_name_here"&gt;
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
</p></li><li><b>INSERT A LINK</b> to be clicked to cause the jump. 
The link looks like this: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;a href="#target_name_here"&gt;hotlink_text&lt;/a&gt;
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
</li></ol>
</a><p><a name="jumpin">
The hotlink_text will appear underlined and in the "link" color. When the 
user clicks the hotlink, the web browser will jump to the target_text. 
</a><a href="#index">Go to index.</a> is a good example of a hotlink. Use the VIEW, SOURCE 
feature of your browser to see the HTML tags surrounding the hotlink and the 
target text at the top of the index. 
</p><hr>
<a name="jump">
<h3>Jump to another file on the same system</h3>
It is easy to create a "hotlink" that will cause the web browser to 
open another file located on the same server as the file from which it is being 
called. The tag format for this kind of link is: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;a href="relative_path_and_filename"&gt;hotlink_text &lt;/a&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
If the file is in the same directory as the calling file, it is only necessary to 
specify the filename. If the file being called is in a different directory, give the 
"relative path and filename". For example, if the calling file is in a 
directory called "schmoo" and the called file is named "chick.gif" 
and is in "schmoo/graphics", the tag would be written 
&lt;a href="graphics/chick.gif"&gt;. If the calling file were in 
"schmoo/graphics" and the called file were in "schmoo", 
the tag would be written &lt;a href="../chick.gif"&gt;  I have placed a file 
called "chick.gif" in the same directory as the file you are currently 
reading. This file can be opened with the following hotlink:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;a href="chick.gif"&gt; Open chick.gif &lt;/a&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
Try out this hotlink (below), then use the "back" key on 
your browser to return to this document. 
</p><p>
</p></a><center><a name="jump">
</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980123232905/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2090/chick.gif">Open chick.gif </a>
<p>
<a href="#index">Go to index.</a></p></center>
<hr>
<a name="jumpto">
<h3>Jump to a document on another system</h3>
Creating a hotlink that jumps to a document on another system anywhere on the Internet 
is very similar to creating a link to a document on the same system. The only difference 
is that instead of using the relative path and filename of the called file, the 
URL (uniform resource locator, or "internet address") is used. The link: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/2426/"&gt;Go to 
"The Pullet Surprize" &lt;/a&gt;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
will take you to a page called "The Pullet Surprize" located at 
http://www/geocities.com/Paris/2426/. You will find a link on that page to return 
you here, or use the "back" button on your browser. Try it!
</p><p>
</p></a><center><a name="jumpto"></a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980123232905/http://www.geocities.com/Paris/2426/">Go to "The Pullet Surprize" </a>
<p>
<a href="#index">Go to index.</a></p></center>
<hr>
<a name="graphics">
<h3>Placing graphic images on your pages</h3>
You can place graphic images on your pages, if the graphic image exists as a separate 
file on your server or some other server on the net. The file format must be readable by 
browsers. I suggest GIF or JPG. Your page shouldn't "depend" on the graphic, 
since some browsers are "text only" and will not display graphics. In it's 
simplest form, the tag to cause a graphic to be placed on the page looks 
like this: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;img src="right.gif" align="bottom"&gt;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
This tag will cause a graphic file named "right.gif", which is in the same 
directory as the file you are reading (index.html) to be displayed in the position 
that it would appear if it were text, like this: 
</p><p>
<img src="index_files/right.gif" align="bottom"> 
</p><p>You can control the position of the image. The most basic way to do this is to treat 
it as text. For example, surrounding the image tag with center tags gives this:
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="index_files/right.gif" align="bottom"></center>
You can also combine the image tag with other elements of your document. For instance, 
the following combination: 
<p>
</p><center>
<table cellpadding="6" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>&lt;img src="right.gif" align=bottom&gt; &lt;a href="#index"&gt;Go to index.&lt;/a&gt;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
gives this display: 
</p><p>
</p></a><center><a name="graphics"><img src="index_files/right.gif" align="bottom"></a><a href="#index">Go to index.</a> </center>
<p>
There is much more to be said about graphic images, since they are a key element in 
really good pages, and can also detract from your page by making it very "slow". 
Stay tuned. 
</p><p>
Please note that the image below is clickable.
</p><p>
</p><center><a href="#index"><img src="index_files/right.gif" border="0" align="bottom"></a>
<a href="#index">Go to index.</a> </center>

<h3>Other HTML editors</h3>
The GeoCities Basic HTML Editor allows persons who are just getting started to 
easily create a very good homepage by "filling in the blanks", but it does 
impose some limitations! Once you have a basic understanding of how HTML works, you can 
use an editor that gives you full control of your page. The great new GeoCities Advanced 
HTML Editor is now available to do just this, and is a great way to make the transition 
to "real" HTML. 
</a><p><a name="other">
If you get deeper into HTML, you may want to use an editor on your own computer and 
transfer the files to GeoCities by FTP or with the EZ Upload Utility (located within the 
</a><a href="https://neocities.org/dashboard">File Manager Utility</a>). The advantage of a
